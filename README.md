COVID-19 live tracker with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT ||using free api

In this Post I have used free api to get the covid-19 data and show them with the help of HTML, CSS and JS. The free api provides the data of COVID-19 as per the country query.

I have used fetch in js to get the data from api.
GOOD LUCK

Stay home stay safe
